## First appliaction
### SOUL
####       The first application I choose is “Soul”, generally this is a communication software, but it is differently from others communication software. In this application people who you talk with are all strangers. 
       
####       When users first time enter the software, it will ask users to do a psychological testing, then it will base on the testing result to match people who has similar result.  The reason why I choose this software is that this a kind new idea of communication software, normally we only use communication application talk to people who you know, however the purpose of this application is letting users to talk with people who you don’t known. The target of this application are young people who wants to make more friends or people who wants to talk to strangers. The reason why this application is so popular is that the idea of this application is pretty avant-garde, it really knows who their target is and what their users need. By research 65% users are under 30 years old, and 85% are female, which means most of users are female who under 30 years old. 
####      The weakness of this application is the target people of this application is too small, because “talk to strangers” is not a mainstream idea, most people still not interesting in this kind of application. So, the point is how they can get more benefits from a certain group of people.
## Second application
### Tik Tok

####       The second application I choose is “Tik Tok”. This application is the biggest original short video sharing platform in china. User can shoot short videos by their own and share it, after users update their videos, other users can watch it and leave comments under the video. The reason why I choose this application is that it is one of the most popular applications in China, almost 60% of mobile users have downloaded this application. 
####       The target people of this application are young people, by research 85% of users are under 25 years old. Young people want to get attention from other people, they share their videos and other people will leave comments or give them “Likes”. When users filming, it will automatically edit the video which helps user looks more beautiful, this is an important reason why girls like to use this application. 
####       The strength of this application is that it is very easy to use, first it has a brief instruction to teach users how to use this app, and it is very easy to learn and use. All the features are very clear, users can easily find where are the features. Also, the features of this application are very powerful, it combines so many technologies in one application, such as shooting video, edit photos or video, sharing platform, and communication software.
